# Devtool
## Front-end Roles on Linux
On the Linux operating system, we can use DevTools in various browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Chromium-based browsers like Brave. The process of accessing DevTools is generally the same as described earlier. Typically, you can access it by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (on Windows) or Cmd+Opt+I (on macOS). If these shortcuts are not available, you can usually find DevTools in the browser menu to open it.

Programming development tools or DevTools play important roles in code development, with key functions as follows:
1.  **Enhancing Development Efficiency:** DevTools enable developers to work quickly and efficiently with tools for coding, project management, testing, and code organization, such as IDEs, text editors, debuggers, and testing frameworks.
    
2.  **Assisting in Maintaining Code Quality:** DevTools help developers review and test code accurately, preventing errors before deploying the code into production, thus maintaining code quality.
    
3.  **Promoting Team Collaboration:** Utilizing DevTools allows teams to work efficiently together with tools for code management, version control systems (VCS), and code collaboration tools, facilitating effective teamwork.
    
4.  **Fostering Self-Development:** DevTools aid developers in learning and improving programming skills by providing tools for code quality checks, learning from mistakes, and adopting new tools and techniques.
    
5.  **Assisting in Project Management:** DevTools enable developers to efficiently manage projects, including version control, library management, and team collaboration, with suitable tools for project management and communication.

## Fundamentals or Operational Principles
There are several Dev Tools available for code development on Linux, aimed at facilitating efficient coding. Here are some of the Dev Tools commonly used on Linux:

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.
-   Visual Studio Code
    
-   IntelliJ IDEA,
    
-   PyCharm
    
-   Eclipse
    
-   NetBeans
    
-   Code::Blocks

#### Text Editors
These are programs used for writing and editing program code in text format. They typically have basic features like syntax highlighting, code formatting, and line numbering.
-   Vim: A highly efficient Text Editor suitable for programming.
    
-   Emacs: A highly customizable Text Editor suitable for advanced users.
    
-   Nano: An easy-to-use Text Editor suitable for beginners.

#### Compilers
They are programs used to translate code written in a human-readable programming language into machine-readable code that computers can understand, such as converting C or C++ code into machine code.
-   GCC: A Compiler that supports programming languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Java, Ada, and more.
    
-   Clang: A Compiler that supports programming languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift.

#### Debuggers
These tools help find and fix errors or bugs in a program by tracking its execution and inspecting values during runtime.
-   GDB: A Debugger that supports programming languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Java, Ada, and more.
    
-   LLDB: A Debugger that supports programming languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift.

#### Version Control Systems
They assist in managing and controlling program code, including recording the history of code changes and facilitating collaboration among team members in software development.
-   Git: A Version Control System that is easy to use and suitable for collaboration.
    
-   Subversion (SVN): A powerful Version Control System suitable for centralized usage.

#### Build Tools
These tools aid in the process of building software, which includes compiling code, managing dependencies, and creating executable files.
-   CMake: A Build Tool that is easy to use and suitable for working on various platforms.
    
-   Automake: A efficient Build Tool suitable for complex usage.

#### Testing Tools
They help ensure the correctness and efficiency of a program by checking its behavior in different scenarios and performing automated testing.

## Call and Outcome
To begin using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), developers on Linux typically follow these steps:
1. Start by opening Visual Studio Code from the terminal using the command:
```bash
code
```
2. Alternatively, if you want to open a project located in the current directory:
```bash
code .
```
-   Once Visual Studio Code is launched, developers can start writing code immediately by selecting the file they want to edit or creating a new file.
    
-   In Visual Studio Code, developers can leverage various features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, linting, debugging, version control integration, and more to facilitate efficient code development.
    
-   Once the code is edited and developed, developers can save the files and perform commits or pushes directly to the Version Control system from Visual Studio Code.

The result is that developers can work with code efficiently and comfortably. The ability to write and edit code quickly, along with the use of various features in Visual Studio Code, enables developers to develop code systematically and efficiently, continuously improving it.

## More Interesting Topics
DevTools on Linux is an essential tool for web developers, offering a plethora of interesting features:

1.  **Secure Connection (HTTPS):** DevTools on Linux can inspect the security of HTTPS connections by indicating whether they are secure or not, and providing information about SSL certification and related security details of websites.
    
2.  **Web Speed Inspection:** DevTools assists in analyzing and checking the performance of websites by providing data on page load times, memory usage, and identifying potential issues that may impact website performance.
    
3.  **CSS and HTML Inspection and Editing:** DevTools on Linux facilitates easy editing of CSS and HTML of websites in real-time, allowing developers to view and modify code instantly.
    
4.  **JavaScript Debugging:** DevTools aids in debugging JavaScript code with tools such as breakpoints, watches, and the console, enabling developers to identify and fix errors efficiently.
    
5.  **Device Testing and Emulation:** DevTools includes tools for testing and emulating website functionality across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring websites function well on various platforms and devices.
    
6.  **App Data Inspection and Management:** DevTools helps in inspecting and managing data related to web applications, such as data stored in local storage, session storage, and cookies.


Additionally, caution should be exercised when using DevTools in contexts involving processing sensitive data, as it can access network traffic data and information stored in local storage, posing potential privacy risks when used in unsecured environments.
